# roman graves

18 August 2025

For the past few weeks I have read several books worth of posts from the incredible site [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](acoup.blog) by Bret Devereaux. I've never been particularly fascinated by the Romans or the way that most historical study is very occupied with military, war and battles. I really appreciate this blog on the other hand for its focus on spotlighting the lives of the peasants and workers that actually made up the majority of pre-modern societies instead of the ruling class we usually hear about but never represent more than 10% of the population. (Think about how every family in a Jane Austen novel is outnumbered by servants, gardeners, cooks, drivers and more while none of the members actually work themselves.)

A [recent post](https://acoup.blog/2025/07/18/collections-life-work-death-and-the-peasant-part-ii-starting-at-the-end/) in a series about the basic contours about life and death for pre-modern peasants and their families genuinely floored me with the way the humanity of these people who lived thousands of years ago can shine through.

Most people are aware that pre-modern societies dealt much higher rates of child mortality. (Around half of all children died before adulthood.) While most of us would assume that people living in these circumstances become detached from their children emotionally, the grief of each loss for these people was not at all any smaller and these people experienced all the same feelings we do today. As examples, the blog shows some epitaphs from Roman graves, here are two written for children who died very young.

> To Claudia Fortunata. Claudia Quartilla set this up for her sweetest daughter Julia Foebe, for her mother and Claudius Felix and Claudius Fortunatus for their most dutiful sister. Oh unworthy crime: a mother made a tomb for her daughter!

> To the spirits of the departed. For Euposia, who lived for one year, eleven months and seventeen days, and for Zosime, who lived for eight months. Their mother Zoe made [this tomb] for her sweetest children.

Here are two more that left me speechless, these were written to wives who died during childbirth. (Something like 10% of women would be expected to die during childbirth if not by other causes.)

> To the departed spirits and eternal memory of Blandinia Martiola, the most blameless girl who lived eighteen years, nine months and five days. Pompeius Catussa, citizen of the Sequani, a plasterer, set this up for his incomparable wife, who was most kind to him. She lived with me for five years, six months and eighteen days without any foul reproach. He had this made during his lifetime for himself and for his wife and dedicated it under the axe. You who read this, go bathe in the baths of Apollo, as I did with my wife. I wish I still could.

> You who pass by, now stand still and linger for a while. Read the misfortune of a mourning man. Read what I, Trebius Basileus, her grieving husband, have written so that you may know that the writing below comes from the heart. She was adorned with all good things, unoffending to her dear ones, guileless, a woman who never committed any wrongdoing. She lived twenty one years and seven months and bore me three sons, whom she left behind when they were small children. Pregnant with her fourth child, she was died in the eighth month. Stunned, now examine the initial letters of the verses and willingly read, I pray, the epitaph of a well-deserving woman. You will recognize the name of my beloved [Grata] wife. _(The Latin forms an acrostic spelling out the name of the deceased, Veturia Grata)_

These inscriptions come from the book [Women and Society in the Roman World by Emily A. Hemelrijk](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/women-and-society-in-the-roman-world/FF8F8BC865F3E681352B3DC234E382C0) which I really hope to get my hands on in the future.

Here are some more series that I'd really recommend from Dr. Devereaux. It's amazing to hear perspectives about things like this from an actual professor of history instead of some youtuber talks like an authority on the subject after clearly having only read one book. Its also great to get an understanding of how much the pop-culture view of history can differ from how it really was especially when looking at works that appear to be historically grounded on a surface level but completely forget the fact that all of the people making up a society are just as emotional and intelligent as those living today.

[Bread, How Did They Make It?](https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/) - A deep dive into how bread was made from the planting of a seed to its consumption which gives a great perspective into the work and lifestyle of subsistence farming which shaped the vast majority of agrarian human life before the industrial revolution.

[Clothing, How Did They Make It?](https://acoup.blog/2021/03/05/collections-clothing-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-high-fiber/) - A second part to the series on bread discussing the labour of textiles and clothing production which took much more labour than you might have expected. Something to think about is that making the minimum amount clothes for a 6 person family required more than 7 hours of work per day, every day of the year. (That's one member in each household's full time occupation, just to ensure that everyone has clothes). Something like a comfortable amount of clothing would be more like 22 hours of work per day, i.e. a major workload even if spread across half the family.

[That Dothraki Horde](https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/) - A look at the Dothraki culture from Game of Thrones and its historicity. Brings really interesting perspective on actual horse-nomad cultures and how Game of Thrones mostly ended up repeating tired stereotypes despite George R.R. Martin's claims to be grounded in history.

[Practical Polytheism](https://acoup.blog/2019/10/25/collections-practical-polytheism-part-i-knowledge/) - Description and demystification of how ancient polytheism actually worked and why it made sense.

[This. Isn't. Sparta.](https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/) - Complete tear-down of the popular idea of Sparta revealing that it was really a slave-state of child-abusers who despised art and did not actually even produce any better warriors than other Greek societies of their time.
