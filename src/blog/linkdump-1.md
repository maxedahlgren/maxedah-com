# linkdump 1

25 August 2025

Im going to start leaving links, quotes and other things I found interesting here, initially planning on a weekly basis but it will of course depend on how often I end up with enough to warrant sharing.

[Google is killing the open web](https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/) - An excellent run down of history of Google's attacks against the open web including the previous and new attempts to remove XSLT from the web standard. XSLT is a really powerful language and the fact that it and XML have been hobbled by Google since 2013 is a major shame. This post also lead to me rebuilding [my Omni RSS script](omni-rss.html) in XSLT.

[Candle Flame Oscillations as a Clock](https://cpldcpu.com/2025/08/13/candle-flame-oscillations-as-a-clock/) - Interesting hack using the unexpected regularity of a candles flicker as a clock.

[How Tea’s Founder Convinced Millions of Women to Spill Their Secrets, Then Exposed Them to the World](https://www.404media.co/how-teas-founder-convinced-millions-of-women-to-spill-their-secrets-then-exposed-them-to-the-world/) ([Without paywall](https://web.archive.org/web/20250819144746/https://www.404media.co/how-teas-founder-convinced-millions-of-women-to-spill-their-secrets-then-exposed-them-to-the-world/)) - Exposé into how the tea dating safety app's male founder tried to hire a female face for the company, used a whole range of unethical marketing, manipulated its users and female employees and completely failed to safeguard sensitive information about its users.

[(Youtube channel) Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere/videos) - I've also spent a lot of time recently watching this channel which I discovered this week which involves a man with an absurdly large workshop and budget creating things of questionable usefulness, he often gives a deep overview into the process of creating the thing especially the long and hard time spent ironing out the inevitable integration issues. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqywL9PkM2s) is a good start about creating the worlds smallest bike in which he also dedicates several days worth of practise in order to be able to ride it.
