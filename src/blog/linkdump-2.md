# linkdump 2

17 September 2025

Here's some stuff that I saw on the internet and thought more people should see.

[You no longer need JavaScript](https://lyra.horse/blog/2025/08/you-dont-need-js/) Modern CSS is way more powerful than I realised and pretty cool.

[A convex polyhedron without Rupert’s property](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18475) A solid 3-D shape has Rupert's property if you can create a hole in it that can fit a copy of the same shape through it. It was conjectured that all solid polyhedra had this property but this paper disproves it and defines a shape that they called the Noperthedron.

[Notes on Managing ADHD](https://borretti.me/article/notes-on-managing-adhd) Seen a lot of these but it feels like this one gives the best overview for both the symptoms, the causes of those symptoms, and ways to think about them and treat them.

[Two Slice](https://joefatula.com/twoslice.html) A font that's only two pixels tall.

[Bear Discovery Feed](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) I mostly just love the unicode ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear logo. It's another link aggregator like Hacker News or what Reddit used to be, I think that the smaller ones of these really just work better since they can be managed by human moderation and are able to have a more focused userbase.

[(Youtube) Developing Film in a Jägerbomb Because I Can (it worked)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Oja2mpYqg)

[(Wikipedia) List of stories set in a future now in the past](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stories_set_in_a_future_now_in_the_past)
