Best and clearest rundown of how dystopian tech surveillance is getting, I would seriously tell anyone and everyone to watch this.

Didn't realise that this is on the official wiki of the CSS working group every language should have this.

[When fonts fight, Times New Roman conquers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/29/when-fonts-fight-times-new-roman-conquers)

Ran into a Guardian article about the favourite fonts of various authors. Typography is one of the many rabbit-holes I keep coming back to and usually in the circles that care a lot about fonts the general consensus is that most of the 'standard' fonts (particularly Arial and Times New Roman) are absolutely terrible, make your eyes bleed and anyone who is serious about reading or writing should obviously be using something super niche. Honestly with how strong their opinions were I usually felt a bit stupid for not really being able to understand the difference.

So it was interesting to learn that from all these people whose fulltime jobs are writing pretty much exclusively used fonts that are included by default in Word.

I'm changing things around a bit. The site's got a bit more like a feed format and I'm thinking that this way I can post stuff with more varied length and have a lower barrier to entry if I want to write something that's just a couple of lines long instead of feeling like I need to fully finish something before putting it out.

[(Youtube) You've Never Heard of the Most Profitable Scam in History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfNIRyPi5QA)

A great video showcasing how google and facebook dont just fuck with consumers but also the companies that buy advertising off them too. It's easy to forget about the other side from consumers that these tech companies like to position themselves between.

Also highly recommend all the other stuff by Fortnine, it's a motorcycle channel but with such high production quality I've been binging it despite having no interest in ever owning a motorbike. Seriously the stuff they put out is better than most TV shows.

[Harry Ranson Center's Movie Posters Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll84)

I found this database more than 5000 old movie posters, pretty cool to browse through them and also found a couple that i might look into printing out (watch The Beguiled 1971 it's amazing btw). Kinda ridiculous how exploitative the majority of them are I don't know how representative this sample is but it's a good reminder of the whole idea that things weren't better/people didn't have higher standards back then, it's only the really good stuff that's remembered as classics.
