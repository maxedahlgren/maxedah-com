I'm changing things around a bit. The site's got a bit more like a feed format and I'm thinking that this way I can post stuff with more varied length and have a lower barrier to entry if I want to write something that's just a couple of lines long instead of feeling like I need to fully finish something before putting it out.

For the last few weeks I've been running around super stressed over finding a thesis topic but it turns out I dont need to submit one until the end of feburary:0

I guess I've got a headstart now at least..

[(Youtube) You've Never Heard of the Most Profitable Scam in History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfNIRyPi5QA)

A great video showcasing how google and facebook dont just fuck with consumers but also the companies that buy advertising off them too. It's easy to forget about the other side from consumers that these tech companies like to position themselves between.

Also highly recommend all the other stuff by Fortnine, it's a motorcycle channel but with such high production quality I've been binging it despite having no interest in ever owning a motorbike. Seriously the stuff they put out is better than most TV shows.

[Harry Ranson Center's Movie Posters Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll84) I found this database more than 5000 old movie posters, pretty cool to browse through them and also found a couple that i might look into printing out (watch The Beguiled 1971 it's amazing btw). Kinda ridiculous how exploitative the majority of them are I don't know how representative this sample is but it's a good reminder of the whole idea that things weren't better/people didn't have higher standards back then, it's only the really good stuff that's remembered as classics.
